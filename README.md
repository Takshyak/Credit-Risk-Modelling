# Credit-Risk-Modelling
The objective of this project is to build a model to predict probability of person defaulting a loan
Credit risk is the risk of a borrower not repaying a loan, credit card or any other type of credit facility. Credit risk is an important topic in the field of finance because banks and other financial institutions heavily invest in reducing their credit risk. 
The main reason behind the global financial crisis in 2008 was that mortgage loans were given to customers with poor credit scores. Poor credit score indicates that a customer has a higher probability of defaulting a loan. This was what happened during the recession in 2008
Credit risk modelling in python can help banks and other financial institutions reduce risk and prevent society from experiencing financial crises as in the case of 2008.
This model can be further used in building application score card and behavioral score cards.

I have modeled the credit risk associated with consumer loans. The jupyter notebook contains detailed explanation with comments, code and visualizations.

List of dummy variables is a file which contains dummy variables for all original variables (discrete and continuous) which is used for analysis.

List of reference variables is a file which contains reference variables for all original variables (discrete and continuous). This helps in comparing the performance of the dummy variables with a reference.
